# exploring-robot-framework

When doing exploratory testing, sometimes your tools to do some of the work and your testing targets intertwine. Without deciding whether I test applications using Robot Framework or test Robot Framework using some application, I set out to explore and create this space for that exploration. 

You will find here examples and starters for Robot Framework tests. 

Requires:
  * nodejs 
  * robot framework browser library <code> pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
  * playwright setup <code> rfbrowser init </code>
